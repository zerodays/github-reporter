The start of the year was spent prepping [air-jam](https://github.com/vucinatim/air-jam) for open source. I focused on consolidating the framework and cleaning up the monorepo structure. This involved publishing updated packages for the SDK and server, alongside a complete documentation overhaul. I added a quickstart guide and architecture deep-dives to make it easier for others to build "AirConsole-style" games using their phones as controllers.

I also released a new project called [github-reporter](https://github.com/vucinatim/github-reporter). It’s a self-hostable microservice that pulls GitHub activity, enriches it with commit diffs and README context, and uses an LLM to generate formatted reports. I built this to automate my own dev journaling and changelogs—it effectively handles the manual work of summarizing what I’ve been working on across different repositories.
