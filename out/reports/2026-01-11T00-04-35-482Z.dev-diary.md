I spent this week prepping **Air Jam** for its open-source transition. The main focus was on documentation; I added a comprehensive quickstart guide and an architecture overview to the platform. It’s now much easier for a new developer to understand how the phone-to-display connection works and get a local environment running in just a few minutes.

On the technical side, I spent time on framework cleanup and consolidation. I refactored the `HostShell` and `ControllerShell` components in the SDK to be more consistent and removed several redundant debug tools that were cluttering the codebase. This makes the internal API leaner and more stable for anyone building on top of it.

Finally, I updated the release pipeline and the `create-airjam` CLI tool. I set up GitHub Actions to automate package publishing and improved the project scaffolding. Now, running the CLI generates a fully functional Pong template by default, providing a concrete starting point rather than a blank screen.
