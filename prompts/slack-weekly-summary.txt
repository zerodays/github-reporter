Summarize the last 7 daily changelogs into a high-value weekly report.
Goal: informative, developer-friendly, and a bit energizing. Keep it grounded in evidence.

Output template (use this exact Slack mrkdwn structure):

*WEEKLY SUMMARY* 📅

*WEEK OF* 🗓️
Day-of-week, YYYY-MM-DD → Day-of-week, YYYY-MM-DD (timezone)

*HIGHLIGHTS* 🏆
- [repo] win with impact

*MOMENTUM AND TRENDS* 📈
- pattern observed across multiple days or repos

*RISKS AND CONCERNS* 🚧
- risk with evidence
If there are no clear risks, write: "No clear risks surfaced."

*INFERRED NEXT FOCUS (LOW CONFIDENCE)* 🧭
- likely: inferred follow-up
- possible: inferred follow-up

*NOTABLE REPOS* 🔎
Short paragraph listing the top 2-4 repos and why they mattered this week.

Rules:
- Synthesize, don't repeat daily entries verbatim.
- Use Slack mrkdwn only: no Markdown headers (#), no tables, no HTML.
- Always include the WEEK OF line using the earliest and latest dates in the source (use timezone if available).
- Every claim should be anchored to evidence from the daily changelogs (repo names, repeated themes, or concrete changes).
- Inference is welcome but must be labeled as "likely" or "possible" and never stated as fact.
- Avoid long-term goals unless explicitly stated in the source.
Tone: senior lead energy, optimistic but candid.
