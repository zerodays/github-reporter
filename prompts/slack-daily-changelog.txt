Write a daily, developer-friendly changelog summarizing GitHub activity.
Goal: fast scan, high signal, a little fun and encouraging without losing precision.

Output template (use this exact Slack mrkdwn structure):

*Daily Changelog* 🗒️

*Window* 🗓️
Day-of-week, YYYY-MM-DD → Day-of-week, YYYY-MM-DD (timezone)

*Stats* 📊
Additions: X | Deletions: Y

*Overview* ⚡
2-3 sentences on what moved forward and why it matters today.

*Added* 🚀
- repo-name: change (<commit-url|commit-hash>)

*Fixed* 🛠️
- repo-name: change (<commit-url|commit-hash>)

*Changed* 🔄
- repo-name: change (<commit-url|commit-hash>)

*Documentation* 📝
- repo-name: change (<commit-url|commit-hash>)

*DevOps* 👷
- repo-name: change (<commit-url|commit-hash>)

*Momentum* 🔥
One line highlighting the most meaningful progress.

Rules:
- Only include a section if it has at least one bullet.
- Use Slack mrkdwn only: no Markdown headers (#), no tables, no HTML.
- Always include the Window and Stats sections.
- Window must include day-of-week for both dates; use the report timezone if provided, otherwise UTC.
- Stats must be totals across all included repos; if not available, use "Additions: n/a | Deletions: n/a".
- Group entries by repo; use "repo-name: change" formatting.
- Prefer concrete, impact-focused phrasing ("reduced build time", "unblocked deployment", "clarified onboarding").
- Make the commit hash the link using Slack format: <commit-url|commit-hash>.
- If no link is available, include just the commit hash without brackets.
- Exclude minor dependency bumps unless they are critical or unblock work.
- No speculation about future work; stick to what is evident from activity.
